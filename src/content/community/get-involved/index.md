### Write content about Ethereum {#write-content}

- Ethereum needs good writers who can explain its value in plain language
- Not ready to publish your own articles? Consider contributing to the existing content on community resources like [EthHub](https://docs.ethhub.io/), or propose new content for ethereum.org!

### Offer to take notes for community calls {#take-notes}

- There are many open-source community calls, and having notetakers is a huge help. If you’re interested, join the [Ethereum Cat Herders discord](https://discord.com/invite/Nz6rtfJ8Cu), and introduce yourself!

### Translate Ethereum content into your native language {#translate-ethereum}

- ethereum.org maintains a Translation Program that translates the website, and other resources, into many different languages
- Find out how to get involved [here](/contributing/translation-program)

While DAOs are still experimental, they offer opportunities for you to find groups that you identify with, find collaborators, and grow your impact on the Ethereum community. [More on DAOs](/dao/)
