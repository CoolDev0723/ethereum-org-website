# Language resources {#language-resources}

The Ethereum community is global and comprised of millions of non-English speakers.

Our aim is to provide educational content in all languages and help overcome the language barriers that make onboarding people from all over the world to Ethereum a challenge.

If you prefer reading in your native language or know someone who doesn’t speak English, you can find a list of useful non-English resources below. Hundreds of thousands of Ethereum enthusiasts gather in these online forums to share news, talk about recent developments, debate technical issues, and imagine the future.

Know of an educational resource in your language? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose) to add it to the list!

## Ethereum.org resources {#ethereum-org}

Ethereum.org is translated is natively translated into over 40 languages which you can find on our [languages page](/languages).

If you are bilingual and want to help us reach more people, you can also get involved with the [ethereum.org Translation Program](/contributing/translation-program/#translation-program) and help us translate the website.
