## Mission and vision {#mission-and-vision}

The Ethereum community aims to be global and inclusive, yet much of its content only caters to English speakers, leaving out the world's 6 billion non-English speakers. For ethereum.org to act as the portal into Ethereum for the worldwide community, we believe providing non-English speakers with Ethereum content in their native languages is essential.

The ethereum.org Translation Program aims to make Ethereum accessible to everyone by translating ethereum.org and other Ethereum content into as many languages as possible.

**Our mission**

- Provide translated versions of the website to empower visitors worldwide to learn about Ethereum in their native language
- Facilitate the onboarding of more members to the global Ethereum community
- Allow for more accessible and more inclusive sharing of Ethereum information and knowledge
- Empower community members to contribute translations to Ethereum and make their mark on the ecosystem
- Identify, connect with, and provide guidance to passionate contributors looking to get involved in the ecosystem

**Our vision**

- Translate essential content for members of the Ethereum community from as many countries and parts of the world as possible
- Support knowledge sharing across languages to create a better informed and educated Ethereum community
- Increase Ethereum's inclusivity and accessibility by removing the language barriers preventing non-English speakers from joining the ecosystem

## How to translate {#how-to-translate}

<InfoBanner shouldCenter emoji=":light_bulb:">
  We encourage you to check out the ethereum.org Translation Style Guide. It contains some of the most important guidelines, instructions, and tips for translators to help localize the website.
  {" "}<Link to="/contributing/translation-program/translators-guide/">View the Translation Style Guide</Link>
</InfoBanner>

1. **[Join our project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org/invite)**  
   You will need to log in to your Crowdin account or sign up if you don’t already have one. All that is required to sign up is an e-mail account and password.

2. **Open the language you want to translate and find a document to work on**  
   The website content is divided into a number of documents and content buckets. You can check the progress of each document on the right – if translation progress is below 100%, please contribute!

   Don't see your language listed? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose) or ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6WX7E97)

   ![Translated and untranslated files on Crowdin](./crowdin-files.png)

   A note on content buckets: we use 'content buckets' within Crowdin to get the highest priority content released first. When you check out a language, for example, [Filipino](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-org/fil#) you'll see folders for content bucket ("1. Homepage", "2. Use Ethereum Pages", etc.).

   We encourage you to translate in this numerical order (1 → 2 → 3 → ⋯) to ensure the highest impact pages are translated first.

   [Learn more about ethereum.org content buckets](/contributing/translation-program/content-buckets/)

3. **Translate**  
   After selecting the file you want to translate, it will open in the online editor. If you have never used Crowdin before, you can use this quick guide to go over the basics.

   ![Crowdin online editor](./online-editor.png)

   **_1 – Left sidebar_**

   - Untranslated (red) – text that has not been worked on yet. These are the strings that you should be translating.
   - Translated (green) – text that has already been translated, but not yet reviewed. You are welcome to suggest alternate translations, or vote on existing ones using the ‘’+’’ and ‘’-‘‘ buttons in the editor.
   - Approved (check mark) – text that has already been reviewed and is currently live on the website.

   You can also use the buttons on top to search for specific strings, filter them by status or change the view.

   **_2 – Editor area_**

   The main translation area – source text is displayed on top, with additional context and screenshots, if available.
   To suggest a new translation, enter your translation in the ‘’Enter translation here’’ field and click Save.

   You can also find existing translations of the string and translations into other languages in this section, as well as translation memory matches and machine translation suggestions.

   **_3 – Right sidebar_**

   This is where you can find comments, translation memory entries and glossary entries. The default view shows the comments and allows translators to communicate, raise issues or report incorrect translations.

   By using the buttons on top, you can also switch to the Translation Memory, where you can search for existing translations, or to the Glossary, which contains descriptions and standard translations of key terms.

   Want to learn more? Feel free to check out the [documentation on using the Crowdin online editor](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/)

4. **Review process**  
   Once you've completed the translation (i.e. all files for a content bucket display 100%), our professional translation service will review (and potentially edit) the content. Once the review is complete (i.e. review progress is 100%), we will add it to the website.

<InfoBanner shouldCenter emoji=":warning:">
  Please do not use machine translation to translate the project. All the translations will be reviewed before being added to the website. If your suggested translations are found to be machine translated, they will be dismissed and contributors who use machine translation often will be removed from the project.

Thank you for your participation in the ethereum.org Translation Program!

**Office hours for translators**

We have office hours for translators on the second Wednesday of every month. These are held in the #office-hours voice channel on the [ethereum.org Discord](https://discord.gg/geKhWjtF), where you can also find the exact times and additional details.

The purpose of office hours is to allow our translators to ask questions about the translation process, provide feedback on the program, share their ideas, or just have a chat with us.
Participants can also learn more about the Translation Program and get some information on becoming an ethereum.org translator.
Finally, we want to use these calls to communicate recent developments with the Translation Program and share key tips and instructions with our contributors.

If you are an ethereum.org translator or would like to become one, feel free to join us during one of these sessions.
