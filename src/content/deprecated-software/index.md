# Deprecated software {#summary-deprecated-software}

This is a list of key Ethereum-related projects and resources which have been deprecated or are no longer maintained. It is important to highlight deprecated work so that users can find viable alternatives and to prevent malicious versions from being distributed.

This list is curated by our community. If there's something missing or incorrect, please edit this page!

## Software {#software}

This section is for software for the desktop, command line, or server which has been deprecated. The main types are wallets, integrated development environments, languages, and Ethereum clients. Definitely be careful to not install deprecated software unless you are certain it is from the original source, e.g. a repo hosted under https://github.com/ethereum.

</p>

Deprecated July 2021

**Summary**

OpenEthereum was the second largest Ethereum implementation by node count. OpenEthereum played an important role in being a key piece of infrastructure for some of the largest users in Ethereum like Etherscan and Gnosis Safe. Its tracing capabilities set it apart from other clients, ensuring reliable and fast synchronization for data providers.

**Archives**

[Archived GitHub repo](https://github.com/openethereum/openethereum)

**History**

**Archives**

[Archived GitHub repo](https://github.com/ethereum/grid)

**History**

Grid could be seen as a successor to Mist, also a standalone, Javascript-based desktop app which included a Geth node. Grid removed the wallet aspect, and added a plugin-style approach for running different kinds of nodes.

**Alternatives**

[DappNode](https://dappnode.io/) is a platform for deploying and hosting DApps, P2P clients, and blockchain nodes.

</p>

Deprecated on March 27, 2019

**Summary**

Meteor Dapp Wallet was a component of Mist, an Ethereum wallet for managing Ethereum accounts and interacting with smart contracts. For many years the Meteor Dapp Wallet web UI was hosted as a subdomain "wallet.ethereum.org".

The Mist Multisig Contract (solidity code) was also included, and Meteor Dapp Wallet featured a user interface for configuring and deploying it.

**Not deprecated: deployed Mist Multisigs**

The Mist Multisig -- deployed as bytecode to Ethereum Mainnet by thousands of users -- continues to be used to store and manage value without incident. [How to Interact with a Mist Multisig Contract](https://support.mycrypto.com/how-to/sending/how-to-interact-with-a-multisig-contract) provides a good overview for how to use these smart contracts.

**Archives**

[Archived GitHub repo](https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum)

**History**

As one of two major, viable clients in the early years of Ethereum (the other being Geth), Parity was a crucial part of the ecosystem. During the Shanghai Attacks of 2016 Parity enabled Ethereum network to continue operating when clients like Geth were taken down by the attack, proving the importance of client diversity.

**Alternatives**

### The DAO {#the-dao}

Hacked and shut down in Summer 2016

**Summary**

The DAO was a smart contract, dapp, and forum for organizing the funding of projects. A vulnerability was exploited and much of the ETH was drained, leading to a community-organized hard fork in order to return ETH to those who had deposited to The DAO. The UX front-end and forum are discontinued.
