When building an Ethereum application with smart contracts, you'll want to run it on a local network to see how it works before deploying it.

Similar to how you might run a local server on your computer for web development, you can use a development network to create a local blockchain instance to test your dapp. These Ethereum development networks provide features that allow for much faster iteration than a public testnet (for instance you donâ€™t need to deal with acquiring ETH from a testnet faucet).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You should understand the [basics of the Ethereum stack](/developers/docs/ethereum-stack/) and [Ethereum networks](/developers/docs/networks/) before diving into development networks.

## What is a development network? {#what-is-a-development-network}

Development networks are essentially Ethereum clients (implementations of Ethereum) designed specifically for local development.

**Why not just run a standard Ethereum node locally?**

You _could_ [run a node](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/#running-your-own-node) (like Geth, Erigon, or Nethermind) but since development networks are purpose-built for development, they often come packed with convenient features like:

- Deterministically seeding your local blockchain with data (e.g. accounts with ETH balances)
- Instantly mining blocks with each transaction it receives, in order and with no delay
- Enhanced debugging and logging functionality

## Available tools {#available-projects}

**Note**: Most [development frameworks](/developers/docs/frameworks/) include a built-in development network. We recommend starting with a framework to [set up your local development environment](/developers/local-environment/).

### Ganache {#ganache}

Quickly fire up a personal Ethereum blockchain which you can use to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.

Ganache provides both a desktop application (Ganache UI), as well as a command-line tool (`ganache-cli`). It is part of the Truffle suite of tools.

### Hardhat Network {#hardhat-network}

A local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code

Hardhat Network comes built-in with Hardhat, an Ethereum development environment for professionals.
