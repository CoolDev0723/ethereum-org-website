Oracles are data feeds that connect Ethereum to off-chain, real-world information so that you can query data in your smart contracts. For example, prediction market dapps use oracles to settle payments based on events. A prediction market may ask you to bet your ETH on who will become the next president of the United States. They'll use an oracle to confirm the outcome and payout to the winners.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Make sure you're familiar with [nodes](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/), [consensus mechanisms](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/), and [smart contract anatomy](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/), specifically events.

## What is an oracle {#what-is-an-oracle}

An oracle is a bridge between the blockchain and the real world. They act as on-chain APIs you can query to get information into your smart contracts. This could be anything from price information to weather reports. Oracles can also be bi-directional, used to "send" data out to the real world.

Watch Patrick explain Oracles:

<YouTube id="ZJfkNzyO7-U" start="10" />

## Why are they needed? {#why-are-they-needed}

With a blockchain like Ethereum, you need every node in the network to replay every transaction and end up with the same result, guaranteed. APIs introduce potentially variable data. If you were sending ETH based on an agreed $USD value using a price API, the query would return a different result from one day to the next. Not to mention, the API could be hacked or deprecated. If this happens, the nodes in the network wouldn't be able to agree on Ethereum's current state, effectively breaking [consensus](/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/).

Oracles solve this problem by posting the data on the blockchain. So any node replaying the transaction will use the same immutable data that's posted for all to see. To do this, an oracle is typically made up of a smart contract and some off-chain components that can query APIs, then periodically send transactions to update the smart contract's data.

### The oracle problem {#oracle-problem}

As we mentioned, Ethereum transactions cannot access off-chain data directly. At the same time, relying on a single source of truth to provide data is insecure and invalidates the decentralization of a smart contract. This is known as the oracle problem.

We can avoid the oracle problem by using a decentralized oracle that pulls from multiple data sources; if one data source is hacked or fails, the smart contract will still function as intended.

### Security {#security}

An oracle is only as secure as its data source(s). If a dapp uses Uniswap as an oracle for its ETH/DAI price feed, an attacker can move the price on Uniswap to manipulate the dapp's understanding of the current price. An example of how to combat this is [a feed system](https://developer.makerdao.com/feeds/) like the one used by MakerDAO, which collates price data from many external price feeds instead of just relying on a single source.

### Architecture {#architecture}

This is an example of a simple Oracle architecture, but there are more ways than this to trigger off-chain computation.

1. Emit a log with your [smart contract event](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/#events-and-logs)
2. An off-chain service has subscribed (usually using something like the JSON-RPC `eth_subscribe` command) to these specific logs.
3. The off-chain service proceeds to do some tasks as defined by the log.
4. The off-chain service responds with the data requested in a secondary transaction to the smart contract.

This is how to get data in a 1 to 1 manner, however to improve security you may want to decentralize how you collect your off-chain data.

The next step might be to have a network of these nodes making these calls to different APIs and sources, and aggregating the data on-chain.

[Chainlink Off-Chain Reporting](https://blog.chain.link/off-chain-reporting-live-on-mainnet/) (Chainlink OCR) has improved on this methodology by having the off-chain oracle network communicate with each other, cryptographically sign their responses, aggregate their responses off-chain, and send only one transaction on-chain with the result. This way, less gas is spent, but you still get the guarantee of decentralized data since every node has signed their part of the transaction, making it unchangeable by the node sending the transaction. The escalation policy kicks in if the node doesn't transact, and the next node sends the transaction.

## Usage {#usage}

Using services like Chainlink, you can reference decentralized data on-chain that has already been pulled from the real world and aggregated. Sort of like a public commons, but for decentralized data. You can also build your own modular oracle networks to get any customized data you're looking for. In addition, you can do off-chain computation and send information to the real world as well. Chainlink has the infrastructure in place to:

- [Get crypto price feeds in your contract](https://chain.link/solutions/defi)
- [Generate verifiable random numbers (useful for gaming)](https://chain.link/solutions/chainlink-vrf)
- [Call external APIs](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data)
  â€“ One novel use of this is [Checking wBTC reserves](https://cointelegraph.com/news/1b-in-wrapped-bitcoin-now-being-audited-using-chainlink-s-proof-of-reserve)

Here is an example of how to get the latest ETH price in your smart contract using a Chainlink price feed:

### Chainlink Data Feeds {#chainlink-data-feeds}

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.6.7;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract PriceConsumerV3 {

    AggregatorV3Interface internal priceFeed;

    /**
     * Network: Kovan
     * Aggregator: ETH/USD
     * Address: 0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331
     */
    constructor() public {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest price
     */
    function getLatestPrice() public view returns (int) {
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int price,
            uint startedAt,
            uint timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();
        return price;
    }
}
```

### Chainlink VRF {#chainlink-vrf}

Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is a provably-fair and verifiable source of randomness designed for smart contracts. Smart contract developers can use Chainlink VRF as a tamper-proof random number generation (RNG) to build reliable smart contracts for any applications which rely on unpredictable outcomes:

- Blockchain games and NFTs
- Random assignment of duties and resources (e.g. randomly assigning judges to cases)
- Choosing a representative sample for consensus mechanisms

Random numbers are difficult because blockchains are deterministic.

Working with Chainlink Oracles outside of data feeds follows the [request and receive cycle](https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-request-model) of working with Chainlink. They use the LINK token to send oracle providers oracle gas for returning responses. The LINK token is specifically designed to work with oracles and are based on the upgraded ERC-677 token, which is backwards compatible with [ERC-20](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).
The following code, if deployed on the Kovan testnet will retrieve a cryptographically proven random number. To make the request, fund the contract with some testnet LINK token that you can get from the [Kovan LINK Faucet](https://kovan.chain.link/).

```javascript

pragma solidity 0.6.6;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/VRFConsumerBase.sol";

contract RandomNumberConsumer is VRFConsumerBase {

    bytes32 internal keyHash;
    uint256 internal fee;

    uint256 public randomResult;

    /**
     * Constructor inherits VRFConsumerBase

     */
    constructor()
        VRFConsumerBase(
            0xdD3782915140c8f3b190B5D67eAc6dc5760C46E9, // VRF Coordinator
            0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088  // LINK Token
        ) public
    {
        keyHash = 0x6c3699283bda56ad74f6b855546325b68d482e983852a7a82979cc4807b641f4;
        fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK (varies by network)
    }

    /**
     * Requests randomness from a user-provided seed
     */
    function getRandomNumber(uint256 userProvidedSeed) public returns (bytes32 requestId) {
        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, "Not enough LINK - fill contract with faucet");
        return requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, userProvidedSeed);
    }

    /**
     * Callback function used by VRF Coordinator
     */
    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {
        randomResult = randomness;
    }
}
```

### Chainlink Keepers {#chainlink-keepers}

Smart contracts can't trigger or initiate their own functions at arbitrary times or under arbitrary conditions. State changes will only occur when another account initiates a transaction (such as a user, oracle, or contract). The [Chainlink Keeper Network](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/introduction/) provides options for smart contracts to outsource regular maintenance tasks in a trust minimized and decentralized manner.

To use Chainlink Keepers, a smart contract must implement [KeeperCompatibleInterface](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/compatible-contracts/), which consists of two functions:

- `checkUpkeep` - Checks if the contract requires work to be done.
- `performUpkeep` - Performs the work on the contract, if instructed by checkUpkeep.

The example below is a simple counter contract. The `counter` variable is incremented by one by every call to `performUpkeep`. You can [check out the following code using Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/Keepers/KeepersCounter.sol)

```javascript
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

// KeeperCompatible.sol imports the functions from both ./KeeperBase.sol and
// ./interfaces/KeeperCompatibleInterface.sol
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.7/KeeperCompatible.sol";

contract Counter is KeeperCompatibleInterface {
    /**
    * Public counter variable
    */
    uint public counter;

    /**
    * Use an interval in seconds and a timestamp to slow execution of Upkeep
    */
    uint public immutable interval;
    uint public lastTimeStamp;

    constructor(uint updateInterval) {
      interval = updateInterval;
      lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;

      counter = 0;
    }

    function checkUpkeep(bytes calldata /* checkData */) external override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory /* performData */) {
        upkeepNeeded = (block.timestamp - lastTimeStamp) > interval;
        // We don't use the checkData in this example. The checkData is defined when the Upkeep was registered.
    }

    function performUpkeep(bytes calldata /* performData */) external override {
        lastTimeStamp = block.timestamp;
        counter = counter + 1;
        // We don't use the performData in this example. The performData is generated by the Keeper's call to your checkUpkeep function
    }
}
```

After deploying a Keeper-compatible contract, you must register the contract for [Upkeep](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-keepers/register-upkeep/) and fund it with LINK, to notify the Keeper Network about your contract, so your work is performed continuously.

- [Keep3r Network](https://docs.keep3r.network/)

### Chainlink API Call {#chainlink-api-call}

[Chainlink API Calls](https://docs.chain.link/docs/make-a-http-get-request) are the easiest way to get data from the off-chain world in the traditional way the web works: API calls. Doing a single instance of this and having only one oracle makes it centralized by nature. To keep it truly decentralized, a smart contract platform would need to use numerous nodes found in an [external data market](https://market.link/).

[Deploy the following code in remix on the kovan network to test](https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.6.7+commit.b8d736ae.js&optimize=false&evmVersion=null&gist=8a173a65099261582a652ba18b7d96c1)

This also follows the request and receive cycle of oracles and needs the contract to be funded with Kovan LINK (the oracle gas) to work.

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/ChainlinkClient.sol";

contract APIConsumer is ChainlinkClient {

    uint256 public volume;

    address private oracle;
    bytes32 private jobId;
    uint256 private fee;

    /**
     * Network: Kovan
     * Oracle: 0x2f90A6D021db21e1B2A077c5a37B3C7E75D15b7e
     * Job ID: 29fa9aa13bf1468788b7cc4a500a45b8
     * Fee: 0.1 LINK
     */
    constructor() public {
        setPublicChainlinkToken();
        oracle = 0x2f90A6D021db21e1B2A077c5a37B3C7E75D15b7e;
        jobId = "29fa9aa13bf1468788b7cc4a500a45b8";
        fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK
    }

    /**
     * Create a Chainlink request to retrieve API response, find the target
     * data, then multiply by 1000000000000000000 (to remove decimal places from data).
     */
    function requestVolumeData() public returns (bytes32 requestId)
    {
        Chainlink.Request memory request = buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);

        // Set the URL to perform the GET request on
        request.add("get", "https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD");

        // Set the path to find the desired data in the API response, where the response format is:
        // {"RAW":
        //   {"ETH":
        //    {"USD":
        //     {
        //      "VOLUME24HOUR": xxx.xxx,
        //     }
        //    }
        //   }
        //  }
        request.add("path", "RAW.ETH.USD.VOLUME24HOUR");

        // Multiply the result by 1000000000000000000 to remove decimals
        int timesAmount = 10**18;
        request.addInt("times", timesAmount);

        // Sends the request
        return sendChainlinkRequestTo(oracle, request, fee);
    }

    /**
     * Receive the response in the form of uint256
     */
    function fulfill(bytes32 _requestId, uint256 _volume) public recordChainlinkFulfillment(_requestId)
    {
        volume = _volume;
    }
}
```

### Build an oracle smart contract {#build-an-oracle-smart-contract}

Here's an example oracle contract by Pedro Costa. You can find further annotation in his article: [Implementing a Blockchain Oracle on Ethereum](https://medium.com/@pedrodc/implementing-a-blockchain-oracle-on-ethereum-cedc7e26b49e).

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.4.21 <0.6.0;

contract Oracle {
  Request[] requests; //list of requests made to the contract
  uint currentId = 0; //increasing request id
  uint minQuorum = 2; //minimum number of responses to receive before declaring final result
  uint totalOracleCount = 3; // Hardcoded oracle count

  // defines a general api request
  struct Request {
    uint id;                            //request id
    string urlToQuery;                  //API url
    string attributeToFetch;            //json attribute (key) to retrieve in the response
    string agreedValue;                 //value from key
    mapping(uint => string) anwers;     //answers provided by the oracles
    mapping(address => uint) quorum;    //oracles which will query the answer (1=oracle hasn't voted, 2=oracle has voted)
  }

  //event that triggers oracle outside of the blockchain
  event NewRequest (
    uint id,
    string urlToQuery,
    string attributeToFetch
  );

  //triggered when there's a consensus on the final result
  event UpdatedRequest (
    uint id,
    string urlToQuery,
    string attributeToFetch,
    string agreedValue
  );

  function createRequest (
    string memory _urlToQuery,
    string memory _attributeToFetch
  )
  public
  {
    uint lenght = requests.push(Request(currentId, _urlToQuery, _attributeToFetch, ""));
    Request storage r = requests[lenght-1];

    // Hardcoded oracles address
    r.quorum[address(0x6c2339b46F41a06f09CA0051ddAD54D1e582bA77)] = 1;
    r.quorum[address(0xb5346CF224c02186606e5f89EACC21eC25398077)] = 1;
    r.quorum[address(0xa2997F1CA363D11a0a35bB1Ac0Ff7849bc13e914)] = 1;

    // launch an event to be detected by oracle outside of blockchain
    emit NewRequest (
      currentId,
      _urlToQuery,
      _attributeToFetch
    );

    // increase request id
    currentId++;
  }

  //called by the oracle to record its answer
  function updateRequest (
    uint _id,
    string memory _valueRetrieved
  ) public {

    Request storage currRequest = requests[_id];

    //check if oracle is in the list of trusted oracles
    //and if the oracle hasn't voted yet
    if(currRequest.quorum[address(msg.sender)] == 1){

      //marking that this address has voted
      currRequest.quorum[msg.sender] = 2;

      //iterate through "array" of answers until a position if free and save the retrieved value
      uint tmpI = 0;
      bool found = false;
      while(!found) {
        //find first empty slot
        if(bytes(currRequest.anwers[tmpI]).length == 0){
          found = true;
          currRequest.anwers[tmpI] = _valueRetrieved;
        }
        tmpI++;
      }

      uint currentQuorum = 0;

      //iterate through oracle list and check if enough oracles(minimum quorum)
      //have voted the same answer has the current one
      for(uint i = 0; i < totalOracleCount; i++){
        bytes memory a = bytes(currRequest.anwers[i]);
        bytes memory b = bytes(_valueRetrieved);

        if(keccak256(a) == keccak256(b)){
          currentQuorum++;
          if(currentQuorum >= minQuorum){
            currRequest.agreedValue = _valueRetrieved;
            emit UpdatedRequest (
              currRequest.id,
              currRequest.urlToQuery,
              currRequest.attributeToFetch,
              currRequest.agreedValue
            );
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
