Uses validity proofs like [ZK-rollups](/developers/docs/scaling/layer-2-rollups#zk-rollups) but data is not stored on the main layer 1 Ethereum chain. This can lead to 10k transactions per second per validium chain and multiple chains can be run in parallel.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You should have a good understanding of all the foundational topics and a high-level understanding of [Ethereum scaling](/developers/docs/scaling/). Implementing scaling solutions such as Validium is an advanced topic as the technology is less battle-tested, and continues to be researched and developed.

## Pros and cons {#pros-and-cons}

| Pros                                                                                                      | Cons                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No withdrawal delay (no latency to on-chain/cross-chain tx); consequent greater capital efficiency.       | Limited support for general computation/smart contracts; specialized languages required.                                                 |
| Not vulnerable to certain economic attacks faced by fraud-proof based systems in high-value applications. | High computational power required to generate ZK proofs; not cost effective for low throughput applications.                             |
|                                                                                                           | Slower subjective finality time (10-30 min to generate a ZK proof) (but faster to full finality because there is no dispute time delay). |
|                                                                                                           | Generating a proof requires off-chain data to be available at all times.                                                                 |
