## Standards overview {#standards-overview}

The Ethereum community has adopted many standards that help keep projects (such as [Ethereum clients](/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) and wallets) interoperable across implementations, and ensure smart contracts and dapps remain composable.

Typically standards are introduced as [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](/eips/) (EIPs), which are discussed by community members through a [standard process](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1).

## Types of standards {#types-of-standards}

Certain EIPs relate to application-level standards (e.g. a standard smart-contract format), which are introduced as [Ethereum Requests for Comment (ERC)](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc). Many ERCs are critical standards used widely across the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Token standards {#token-standards}

- [ERC-20](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.
- [ERC-721](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
- [ERC-777](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-777/) - A token standard improving over ERC-20.
- [ERC-1155](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) - A token standard which can contain both fungible and non-fungible assets.
