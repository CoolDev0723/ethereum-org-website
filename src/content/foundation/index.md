# About the Ethereum Foundation {#about-the-ethereum-foundation}

<Logo/>

The [Ethereum Foundation](http://ethereum.foundation/) (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting [Ethereum](/what-is-ethereum/) and related technologies.

The EF is not a company, or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Ethereum, nor they are the only organization that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies. The EF is one part of a much larger [ecosystem](/community/).

## Ethereum Foundation Initiatives {#ethereum-foundation-initiatives}

### Ecosystem Support Program {#ecosystem-support-program}

The [Ecosystem Support Program](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/) exists to provide both financial and non-financial support to projects and entities within the greater Ethereum community, in order to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. The Ecosystem Support Program is an expansion of the original Ethereum Grants Program which mainly focused on financial support.

Learn more about the Ecosystem Support Program, past grant recipients, and the grant application process at [esp.ethereum.foundation](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/). You can also view the [Ecosystem Support Program Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/ecosystem-support-program/) or follow [@EF_ESP](https://twitter.com/EF_ESP) for their latest news and announcements.

### Devcon {#devcon}

Since 2014, the Ethereum Foundation has organized Devcon, the annual conference for all Ethereum developers, researchers, thinkers, and makers.

You can access video content of conference presentations for every year since its inception at [archive.devcon.org](https://archive.devcon.org/).

Learn more at [devcon.org](https://devcon.org/), check out the [Devcon Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/devcon/), or follow [@efdevcon](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon) for the latest announcements.

### Fellowship Program {#fellowship-program}

The [Ethereum Foundation Fellowship Program](https://fellowship.ethereum.foundation/) is a pilot project that focuses on seeking opportunities in emerging economies. Developing countries today account for over 80% of the worldâ€™s population. Amongst about 400,000 babies born every day around the world, more than 360,000 are born in developing countries. People in developing nations represent not only our future as a people, but they may also represent the next billion active users of Ethereum.

The Fellowship Program provides the EF an opportunity to work with change-makers, whose projects have high potential to create impact in emerging economies by using Ethereum. The program features a unique experience that includes mentorship, expertise and access to leaders in the Ethereum ecosystem.
