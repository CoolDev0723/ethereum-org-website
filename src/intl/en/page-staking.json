  "page-staking-51-desc-1": "Staking makes joining the network as a validator more accessible so it’s likely that there’ll be more validators in the network than exists today. This will make this kind of attack even harder as the cost of an attack will increase.",
  "page-staking-accessibility": "More accessible",
  "page-staking-accessibility-desc": "With easier hardware requirements and the opportunity to pool if you don’t have 32 ETH, more people will be able to join the network. This will make Ethereum more decentralized and secure by decreasing the attack surface area.",
  "page-staking-at-stake": "Your ETH is at stake",
  "page-staking-at-stake-desc": "Because you have to stake your ETH in order to validate transactions and create new blocks, you can lose it if you decide to try and cheat the system.",

  "page-staking-deposit-address-desc": "If you’ve already followed the setup instructions on the launchpad, you’ll know you need to send a transaction to the staking deposit contract. We recommend you check the address very carefully. You can find the official address on ethereum.org and a number of other trusted sites.",
  "page-staking-desc-1": "Rewards are given for actions that help the network reach consensus. You'll get rewards for batching transactions into a new block or checking the work of other validators because that's what keeps the chain running securely.",
  "page-staking-desc-2": "Although you can earn rewards for doing work that benefits the network, you can lose ETH for malicious actions, going offline, and failing to validate.",
  "page-staking-desc-3": "You'll need 32 ETH to become a full validator or some ETH to join a staking pool. You'll also need to run an execution client (formerly 'Eth1 client'). The launchpad will walk you through the process and hardware requirements. Alternatively, you can use a backend API.",
  "page-staking-description": "Staking is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software. As a validator you’ll be responsible for storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain. This will keep Ethereum secure for everyone and earn you new ETH in the process. This process, known as proof-of-stake, is being introduced by the Beacon Chain.",

  "page-staking-pos-explained": "Proof-of-stake explained",
  "page-staking-pos-explained-desc": "Staking is what you need to do to become a validator in a proof-of-stake system. This is a consensus mechanism that is going to replace the proof-of-work system currently in place. Consensus mechanisms are what keep blockchains like Ethereum secure and decentralized.",

  "page-staking-sharding": "Unlocks sharding",
  "page-staking-sharding-desc": "Sharding is only possible with a proof-of-stake system. Sharding a proof-of-work system would dilute the amount of computing power needed to corrupt the network, making it easier for malicious miners to control shards. This isn’t the case with randomly-assigned stakers in proof-of-stake.",
  "page-staking-solo": "Stake solo and run a validator",
  "page-staking-solo-desc": "To begin the staking process, you’ll need to use the staking launchpad. This will walk you through all the setup. Part of staking is running a consensus client, which is a local copy of the blockchain. This can take a while to download onto your computer.",

  "page-staking-validators": "More validators, more security",
  "page-staking-validators-desc": "In a blockchain like Ethereum it is possible to censor and reorder transactions to suit you if you control a majority of the network. But, to control a majority of the network, you need a majority of validators, and for this you’d need to control a majority of the ETH in the system – that’s a lot! This amount of ETH grows every time a new validator enters the system, bolstering the security of the network. Proof-of-work, the security model proof-of-stake will replace, requires the validators (miners) to have specialist hardware and lots of physical space – entering the system as a miner is difficult so security against majority attacks doesn't increase as much. Proof-of-stake doesn't have these requirements, which should grow the network (and its resistance to majority attacks) to sizes that aren't possible with proof-of-work.",
  "page-staking-withdrawals": "Withdrawals won't be live right away",
  "page-staking-withdrawals-desc": "You won't be able to withdraw your stake until future upgrades are deployed. Withdrawals will be available in a minor upgrade following The Merge of Mainnet with the Beacon Chain."
